# Gracie Guan Portfolio & AI Chat

Hi! I'm Gracie Guan, a creator, problem solver, and digital generalist passionate about the intersection of product design, AI, and business. This is my personal portfolio site, designed to showcase my work, skills, and to let you chat with my AI twin!

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project is a full-stack, modern portfolio website with an integrated AI-powered chat assistant. Visitors can explore my projects, learn about my background, and have a "virtual coffee chat" with an AI version of me, powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). 
You can also book a real chat with me through the integrated calendly section if you like!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
- React 
- SCSS 
- IBM Carbon Design System


**Backend:**
- FastAPI 
- LangChain (RAG pipeline)
- OpenAI API (LLM, embeddings)
- FAISS 

## ‚ú® Highlights
- **AI Chatbot**: Ask anything about me. My experience, skills, projects or fun facts. The AI only answers based on real, context-rich data from my portfolio.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines OpenAI LLM with a local FAISS vector store for accurate, context-aware answers.
- **Beautiful, Responsive UI**: Custom SCSS and Carbon Design for a polished, mobile-friendly experience.
- **Interactive Project Cards**: Hover effects, dynamic tags, and a clean layout.
- **Calendly Integration**: Schedule a real chat with me directly from the site.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Cleanly separated frontend and backend for easy deployment and scaling.

I'm always curious about how different disciplines connect. If you're interested in my work, want to chat about AI, or just want to say hi, welcome to reach me out.
