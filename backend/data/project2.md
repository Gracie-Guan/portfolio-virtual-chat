# Project2_TCDRenter
### Project Summary
The TCD Renters' Solidarity Network struggled with a limited digital presence, hindering their ability to engage students and drive change in housing issues.

our team developed a comprehensive website solution, to coordinate campaigns around issues faced by the collective student renter community at Trinity College Dublin. The project aimed to improve the organization's legitimacy, provide resources for student renters, promote advocacy, and increase student engagement.

### Problem Statement
The TCD Renters' Solidarity Network had a limited digital presence, which hindered their ability to engage with students and support institutional change effectively. They lacked a centralized platform to share information, resources, and calls to action related to student housing issues.

### Goals and Objectives
* Improve the organization's legitimacy through a professional website
* Provide a resources hub for Trinity renters and the wider student renter community in Dublin
* Promote advocacy and communication with press and stakeholders
* Increase student engagement with the Network online and offline

### Research
The team conducted comprehensive research to understand their target audience and develop an effective advocacy website for the TCD Renters' Solidarity Network.

* User Research: Due to limited access to direct user research, the team leveraged personal experiences, particularly from international students, to create user personas and empathy maps. They developed three main personas: an international student, an on-campus accommodation student, and a student union member. These personas helped identify key pain points and needs within the student renter community.
* Market Analysis: The team analyzed websites with similar missions, including housing advocacy groups and student union websites, to gather inspiration and identify best practices in content structure, visual design, and user engagement strategies.
* Social Media Research: Referencing the Coimisiún na Meán's Digital News Report Ireland 2023, the team gained insights into social media usage among their target demographic. This informed their decision to focus primarily on Instagram for social media integration.
* Accessibility Research: Committed to creating an inclusive website, the team studied WCAG 3.0 guidelines and best practices for color contrast, typography, and layout to accommodate users with various disabilities.
* Dublin Housing Market Research: To provide valuable resources, the team gathered information on rental prices, transportation options, and cost of living statistics relevant to students in Dublin.

This comprehensive research approach enabled the team to create a user-centered design that effectively addressed the needs of the TCD Renters' Solidarity Network and its target audience, guiding decisions on content structure, feature prioritization, and visual design throughout the project.
