# Behavioural Questions
### Walk me through your current role at Scale AI.
My work in Scale AI can be divided into 3 parts: project management, resolve issues in pipeline, produce docs, optimising workflow and ensure delivery on time; Support AI Data contributors, include onboarding, training, escalations, enhance engagement; Quality Assurance - conduct quality analysis on the data, make plan for improvement, produce SOP for review process for my team leads.
### What tools or systems are you comfortable using? (e.g. CRM, dashboards, automation tools)
* Google sheet, AirTable, Redash
### How do you handle shifting priorities or fast-changing workflows?
* Always prepare for priorities shifting. Divide and organize resource and prepare for allocation anytime
* Handling 5 projects at once
### Tell me about a time when you improved or fixed an operational issue.
* onboarding failure 80%
* walk through the process myself, 1 on 1 discussion with 5 data contributors, discover miscommunication and ambiguous instructions, improve by revising document, record step by step video
* onboarding failure rate drop to 20% in 2 months

### Describe a situation where you identified an inefficiency in a business process. What steps did you take to improve it? (Intent: Assessing problem-solving and process optimisation skills.)
When my current project started, the annotator-generated data had a high defect rate; 70% of the data was wasted, and the annotators were blocked because they failed the task.

To analyse the root cause, I invited a small group of annotators to brainstorm the difficulty they encountered during the process. I found out they didn’t understand the instructions before they start tasking due to three key reasons. 1, The documents are in English and long, which means the Chinese annotators have to spend more than an hour to read through; 2, the project onboarding session is unpaid, they intend to spend less time on it; 3, the instruction is ambiguous in several subjective metrics.

I flagged these issues to the leadership and suggested that we should improve the onboarding process. Initially, the onboarding only provided written documents and a quiz. What I did is first discuss with the client-facing project manager to clarify some vague instructions. Second, replace the document reading session with an onboarding webinar to explain the project requirements and have a live project walk through with them.

With these efforts, the data defect rate dropped to 30% in one week. This approach has been extended to other pipelines.
### Give an example of a time when your analysis influenced a major business decision. (Intent: Understanding how your insights drive business impact.)
When I worked at Sharkgulf in 2022, our sales were hit hard because almost all the major cities in China were in lockdown. The CEO wanted to explore the market that is less affected by the pandemic policy, Macau. My task is to analyse the electric scooter market in Macau to help the CEO decide if we should break into Macau and how to do it.

I was in Shanghai, which was also under lockdown, so I couldn't go to Macau. I collected three types of data: firstly, data on traffic and vehicles from the Macau Statistics Bureau; secondly, I worked with one of our business partners in Hong Kong to carry out questionnaires for motorbike dealers; I happened to have a friend who works with a food delivery company in Macau, she helped me to find a dozen delivery men for the survey and interview. With this data, I developed a key insight: With the battery swapping subscription fee, riding an electric scooter will cost more than the fuel scooters for daily commuting, but it will be more economical for delivery people.

I suggested that we enter the market from the B-side cooperation and propose to delivery companies from the perspective of data management of delivery vehicles and reduction of operating costs. The CEO agreed with my findings and the sales team contacted the food delivery company, we got an order with 100 scooters from them a few months later.
### Can you share an example of when you had to prioritise requirements for a project? What methodology did you use? (Intent: Evaluating your ability to make strategic decisions and prioritise effectively.)
The most recent situation I have come across was when I was working on the graduate project. I am leading a group of 6 to develop an app aiming to provide accurate and up-to-date menu information to the user. In the planning phase, my teammates had more than 10 ideas about the features, and our supervisor also provided some suggestions. But we need to develop a MVP in two months, having 10 feature is unfeasible, as the project manager I had to pick out the most essential functionality for the MVP, and make sure we can develop a demo in the tight schedule.
I made a user journey map to analyse what a user would do when they need to find a menu in a restaurant, which is the most important use case for this app, and sorted the feature ideas we have by the relevance and contribution to the end goal. Then I discussed with our supervisor to have a clear estimate of the development time for each feature. I led a meeting with my team, making sure everyone understand how and why we choose these feature to build the MVP.
We have finished the demo on time, and having the highest level of completion among all the projects in the project showcase, got 90% positive feedback with demo, and scored 75.

### Tell me about a time when you had to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. How did you prioritize them? Intent: Measuring time management and prioritization skills.
IDM challenged my ability to multi-tasking. Second term, I have 9 final assignment due in 2 weeks.

Made a chart, write down all the assignments, estimate working hours and credits for each, then sorted by deadline. I generally not good at multi tasking, but I divided my calendar to many small sprint, focus on one assignment per sprint. I schedule all these sprint into my google calendar, execute it strictly and log my progress everyday. Got eye infection when I am doing one of my coding assignment, adjust my plan to work on sensor technology first.

Some of professors gave us extension but I finished all the assignment before the old deadline. All the assignment have got expected score.

### BQ story 1: Onboarding Process Improvement
**Situation**:
* Onboarding pass rate <20% → resource shortage for project
* Personally tested process + conducted 2 focus groups with failed contributors
* Docs in Google Docs → can’t translate
* Assessment time too short for non-native speakers
**Action**:
Collaborated with:
* PMs → escalated issues, aligned on redesign
* Internal Auditor → identified failure patterns
* Contributor team leads → supported rollout to teams
I did:
* Chinese translation, walkthrough video, “Do & Don’t” doc
* Extended time limit
**Result**:
* Pass rate ↑ to 80%
* Doubled active contributors in 1 month
* Process adopted by other pipelines

### BQ story 2: Critical Feedback
**Situation**
* Masters, full stack dev, low score
* Lecturer gave structured feedback, but the tone isn’t friendly
**Actions**
* Finish my tasks with higher priority, research paper
* review my own coding with the feedback, realised my main functionality failed due to minor mistake after I changed some frontend element, and didn’t test before submission
* Fix the bugs according to feedback as much as possible, and email my revised version to my lecturer，asked for advice
**Result**
* Although this didn’t change my end score, but I didn’t let allow it to destroy my confident and interest in coding neither, I chose to work on frontend in my final project after that.

### BQ story 3: Macau/HK market research
**Situation**
* Assigned to evaluate HK & Macau market entry
* Needed cross-team input: CEO, engineers, local partners
**Actions**
* Collected gov data, interviewed B2B partners
* Talked to local dealers via partner network
* Reviewed regulations → discussed feasibility w/ engineers
**Result**
* Delivered decision support report (demand, costs, risks)
* CEO used it for go/no-go decision
* learning: priority in different roles

### BQ story 4: Spammer Detection & Workflow Fix
**Situation:**
* Spotted AI-generated submissions in Chinese tasks → highly risky for model quality
**Action:**
* Investigated → non-Chinese names, same IP, same resumes, failed assessments
* Identified ~30% of contributors as potential spam accounts
* Short-term fix: restrict access, daily monitoring, pattern detection
* Long-term fix: escalated → found bug in Growth team’s auto-assessment tool
**Result:**
* Led to redesign of contributor onboarding workflow → spam near-zero now
